# TODO
For Renderer:
    Font rendering
    Line rendering
    Framebuffer
    Graphics Context
    Uniform Buffer?

Low Priority:
    Make a weakref system using std::weak_ptr? or maybe std::object_ptr?

Medium Priority:
    Add ability to pass args from sandbox to Daybreak when starting engine. This is stuff like initial window size etc.
